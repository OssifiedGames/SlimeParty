# SlimeParty
A Small and cozy Lo-Fi game made for the Game.Off 2023

Hi everyone my name is Manuel but my professional Alias is Ossified and i am in charge of OssifiedGames, for now i am an individual company but i hope to grow with time and start the dream of my life: create a videogame company and deliver wonderful games.
This is an open source project of my creation, you just need to attribute me whenever you use it, stream it, modify it or create variations.
Due to the rush of the jam and my full time job i had no time to organize the code in an ordinate way but you are incouraged to do so if you want.

The Jam theme was about SCALE so i made a slime party game in .io Style but with the 3D stunning graphic of Unreal Engine.
As you grow you will destroy always larger props and at the end you almost are as big as the map. Graphic effects and sounds will change accordingly.
The packaged game on Itch.io is compatible for Windows and Linux systems.

I hope you will have fun and relax with my little project. :D

With love: Ossified.
